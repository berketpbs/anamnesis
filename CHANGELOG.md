and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project structure as Rust workspace
- Core data types and abstractions
- SQLite storage layer with migrations `V01`–`V06`
- Git-versioned wiki system
- MCP server: `memory_query`, `memory_write_page`, `memory_handoff_accept`
- Lifecycle hooks capture system, with redaction before storage
- LLM provider abstraction (Anthropic Messages API), optional throughout
- Session consolidation, deterministic when no model is configured
- HTTP server for hook delivery and handoff pickup (`/hook`, `/handoff`,
  `/health`) — no UI and no authentication
- CLI entry point
- Cross-harness workstreams: named threads of work with per-thread handoff
  slots, plus the `workstream_start` and `workstream_status` MCP tools
- Retrieval over four fused signals: FTS5, entities, link neighbours, and an
  opt-in local embedder (`ANAMNESIS_EMBED_ENABLED=1`)
- Raw spool: every observation appended to `raw/` as immutable JSONL
- `anamnesis reindex` — rebuild the index from `wiki/` and `raw/`
- `anamnesis bootstrap` — seed a new project's memory from its git history
- CI: fmt, clippy, and tests on Linux and Windows for every push and PR
- `[capture] ignore_paths` is enforced: events naming an excluded path are
  dropped before an observation exists, so nothing about them reaches the
  index, the spool, or a summary

### Changed
- Configuration marker is `.anamnesis.toml`; `.ai-memory.toml` is read as a
  fallback for projects migrating from upstream `ai-memory`
- `ANAMNESIS_DB` became `ANAMNESIS_DATA_DIR`; memory lives outside the
  repository it describes

### Fixed
- Backlinks now resolve when the target page is written after the page that
  links to it
- Rebuilt sessions come back closed when the transcript records their end

### Removed
- The empty `anamnesis-workstream` crate; workstreams live in core, store,
  and mcp instead
- The `new-session` CLI command; sessions are created by hooks and MCP

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- Project initialization
- Workspace structure with 10 modular crates
- Configuration templates
- Documentation and contribution guidelines
